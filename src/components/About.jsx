            Private aviation made simple
          </h1>
          <p>
            In 2015 COJETlaunched with a vision to make flying private simple to
            understand, accessible to more, and at a palatable price point. We
            make the awkward trips easy. We put you back in control of your
            schedule. We get you home in time for dinner. Our focus is, was, and
            always will be – <strong>you.</strong>
